#### Information
The club Project Protect Our Ocean has tasked us with creating a website to help their cause. We will create a website that acts as a home site for them, and help them spread information to more audiences. Our project ideas and plans include deployment of our website, utilizing all requests from our sponsor (leaders of the club Project Protect Our Ocean), and adding in technicals that can be easily implemented and read by users. Specifics include pages that allow users to learn more about oceans, oceanagraphy, the current state of our oceans, and what they can do to contribute, donate, or join the club.

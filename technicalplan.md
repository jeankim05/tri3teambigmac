### Technical Ideas
* MVC of a database for all club members
* When members sign up to be a member, we will collect their data and store it in a databsae
* They can use that data to log in as the member and officers can have special log in accomadations

### Data and any Data Privacy or Security needed
* We plan to make it so that only certain logins will be able to see certain databases and lists
* We are unsure as to how exactly this will happen, but things such as email information, passwords, and usernames, will be hidden for all users except for certain ones that come to the website. Only the club president will be given access to this information, through his account which upon signing in will allow him to access more on the website.
